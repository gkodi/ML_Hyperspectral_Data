Specifically, we will use the concrete_autoencoder library to train an autoencoder on our hyperspectral data and select the top K most important features based on the reconstruction error. We will apply this method to a real-world hyperspectral dataset and evaluate the performance of our feature selection approach using a classification task.\n","\n","**Link to the original code**: [Link](https://github.com/mfbalin/Concrete-Autoencoders)\n","\n","**Link to the paper**: [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09346)\n","\n","Autoencoders are a type of neural network that learns to reconstruct input data from a compressed representation, also known as the latent space. They consist of two main components: an encoder that maps the input data into the latent space, and a decoder that reconstructs the input data from the latent representation.\n","\n","Autoencoders have been shown to be effective in feature selection by learning a compressed representation of the input data that retains the most important features. By training the autoencoder on the input data and then examining the importance of the latent features, we can select the top K most important features and discard the rest.\n","\n","**Important note**ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥!
