GA-PLSR for Feature Selection\n","Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional data sets that contain hundreds or thousands of spectral bands. However, not all of these bands are useful for analysis or modeling. In fact, including too many bands in a model can lead to overfitting and poor performance. Therefore, it is essential to perform feature selection to identify the most informative spectral bands for a given application.\n","\n","One approach to feature selection is **partial least squares regression (PLSR)**, which is a multivariate regression technique that models the relationship between a set of predictor variables (spectral bands) and a response variable (e.g., vegetation index, mineral abundance, etc.). PLSR can also be used for dimensionality reduction, as it projects the high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space that captures the most relevant information.\n","\n","However, **selecting the optimal subset of spectral bands for PLSR can be a challenging task**, especially when dealing with a large number of variables. One solution is to use a **genetic algorithm (GA)** to search for the best subset of variables that maximizes the predictive performance of the PLSR model. This approach is known as GA-PLSR, and it has been shown to be effective for feature selection in hyperspectral images.\n","\n","The basic idea behind GA-PLSR is to create a population of candidate subsets of spectral bands (i.e., chromosomes), evaluate their performance using a fitness function (e.g., cross-validation error), and then use genetic operators (e.g., mutation, crossover) to generate new candidate solutions. The process is repeated for several generations until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum number of iterations).\n","\n","## **Using the Notebook**\n","\n","1. Enter the name of the target column in your DataFrame. This is the column that you want to predict using your PLSR model. Specify the required parameters for the GA-PLSR algorithm. These include the number of variables to select (n_components), the number of chromosomes in the population (pop_size), and the number of generations (n_gen) to run the algorithm.\n","\n","2. Load your data file (CSV) using the provided function *load_data()*. This function takes the path to your CSV file as input and returns a pandas DataFrame containing your data.\n","\n","2. Split to Train/ Test using *split_data()* function.\n","\n","4. Run the GA-PLSR algorithm, which takes your data DataFrame, target column name, and algorithm parameters as inputs. This function returns a pandas DataFrame containing the relevant features after dimensionality reduction.\n"," \n"," 🚩🚩 **This part can take time** (depents on your data size).\n","\n","\n","5. Use the selected features to train your PLSR model with *Fit_PLSR* function\n","\n","⚡⚡ **Important**: Typically, GA-PLSR is applied to the training set rather than the entire dataset to prevent overfitting. In this notebook, the data is also split during the process, and GA-PLSR is applied only to the training set.\n","\n","**Credit**:
