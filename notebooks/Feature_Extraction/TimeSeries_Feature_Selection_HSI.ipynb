Hyperspectral images contain a large number of spectral bands, making it difficult to analyze and extract meaningful information. Therefore, feature selection is necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining relevant information.\n","\n","The approach used in this notebook is based on the featurize package in Python, which calculates a set of statistical features from time series data. These features include amplitude, maximum, median, skewness, and many others. By applying featurize to each spectral band as a time series, a set of features is generated for each band, reducing the dimensionality of the data.\n","\n","The output of the code is a set of
